# SkinCancerClassification

This paper presents the design and optimization of CNNs that use deep learning principles to process skin lesion images and classify them into one of seven major types. Due to the fine-grained differences in the appearance of skin abnormalities and technical skill required to diagnose, it is beneficial to develop an automated system to help physicians classify images. Using the HAM10000 data set, this study develops four CNNs: two manually constructed CNNs and two transfer learning CNNs employing the ResNet50 and XCeption pre-trained models. The networks are tuned using Scikit-learn and Keras packages to identify the optimal number and type of layers, nodes per layer, and hyperparameters. The objective of the optimization is to generate a model that maximizes the number of true positive results due to the grave impacts of misdiagnoses. Results from the optimization yielded model accuracies of 70%, 75%, 77%, and 93% for the four models, respectively, indicating that the XCeption model is most reliable for skin lesion classification.
